###Personal Profile
I received B.S. and M.S. in Geodesy and Survey Engineering from Chang’an University, China in 2007 and 2010, respectively. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Tongji University since September 2010. I have submitted my Ph.D. thesis and expect to receive Ph.D. degree in November 2014. During my Ph.D. candidature, I also studied at Miami University (USA) as a part of my Ph.D. joint training program from October 2012 to January 2014 (16 months). I have specialized in GNSS ionosphere modeling and I have independently developed a fully operational regional/global ionosphere-modeling software platform which currently runs automatically and generate global ionosphere maps with around 300 stations, as shown in the [service platform](http://geodesy.cn/ionosphere). During my Ph.D. candidature, I also published 10 journal papers in the areas of ionosphere modeling and GNSS data processing and 1 patent regarding the ionosphere [TEC broadcasting service](http://iris.geodesy.cn/index_en.html). I received a number of outstanding papers/graduate awards due to my research performance.
