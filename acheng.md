##Personal Profile
I received B.S. and M.S. in Geodesy and Survey Engineering from Chang’an University, China in 2007 and 2010, respectively. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Tongji University since September 2010. I have submitted my Ph.D. thesis and expect to receive Ph.D. degree in November 2014. During my Ph.D. candidature, I also studied at Miami University (USA) as a part of my Ph.D. joint training program from October 2012 to January 2014 (16 months). I have specialized in GNSS ionosphere modeling and I have independently developed a fully operational regional/global ionosphere-modeling software platform which currently runs automatically and generate global ionosphere maps with around 300 stations, as shown in the [service platform](http://geodesy.cn/ionosphere). During my Ph.D. candidature, I also published 10 journal papers in the areas of ionosphere modeling and GNSS data processing and 1 patent regarding the ionosphere [TEC broadcasting service](http://iris.geodesy.cn/index_en.html). I received a number of outstanding papers/graduate awards due to my research performance.

##Research Interests
ionospheric model, atmospheric monitoring, GNSS positioning, data processing techniques

##Programming/IT Skills
know Linux & Mac OS X well; familiar with C++, Fortran, Bash, HTML, CSS, VBScript, XML, XSL; be competent to complete large data processing platform; be good at making website; have a basic operation of GAMIT & Bernese.

I began learning HTML and making website in 2003 when I got into college. And I’m very interested in internet technology. I made several versions of my homepage. Also, I developed some projects of website, such as online music service, individual blogging software, online travel-booking and so on. So I’m quite familiar with HTML, CSS, VBScript, XML, XSL and PHP these programming languages. I started learning and using Linux in 2007. The first Linux distribution I used is Fedora 7. Then I fell in love with Ubuntu in 2010. But I don’t think Ubuntu Unity is a nice desktop. MATE is my daily used desktop at work. While, Linux Mint is also an easy-to-use Linux distribution.

I started learning C++ in 2007 when I studied for a Master’s degree. More than 30,000 lines of C++ code are written by myself, including the basic functions of positioning and other features, such as reading navigation and observations as RINEX format, Lagrange interpolation and so on. Also, various softwares are developed. For instance, relative positioning software which is developed during my Master’s study. During my PhD’s study, I developed a software for regional ionospheric modeling, a single frequency PPP software and an automatic data processing system for global ionospheric model and service platform. It can accomplish downloading global GNSS observations, preprocessing and processing of data, graphical visualization of TEC maps, releasing the IONEX products of the ionosphere, real-time pushing operating status of the system, and updating website of the service platform. All of these are automatically running on the server.
